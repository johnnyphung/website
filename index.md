      Hi, my name is Johnny, I’m 32 and live in Vancouver, BC. Life here feels steady, I’ve built a career I love, a cozy home, and I keep busy with hobbies that bring me joy. Over the past year, I’ve been working with Olive Fertility on my journey to becoming a parent. Surrounded by my big Vietnamese family and all my close friends, I get to live a life full of love and support throughout all my endeavors and major life milestones. They say it takes a village… and this village has been beside me through this entire family planning process, and their support means everything. I am fortunate enough that my network has led me to have a known egg donor, and thanks to that person’s kindness I now have a healthy embryo ready for the next steps
      
      That next step is where I’m hoping to meet someone special — a surrogate with an open heart who can help bring this dream to life. This journey has had its share of ups and downs, but it’s shown me how much becoming a father truly means to me. I’m excited, hopeful, and ready to move forward.

    title: Surrogacy (Gestational Carrier Program) FAQ
    text: >+
      <a href="https://www.olivefertility.com/" target="_blank">Olive Fertility Centre</a> is experienced in helping family units who require a surrogate to have a child. A surrogate is also called a gestational carrier (GC). The GC carries and delivers a child for a couple or person, called the intended parents. The GC does not use her own eggs and is therefore not related to the child she is carrying.<br><br>

      #### How do I know if I am eligible or a good fit?

      In order to become a GC at Olive, the GC must:

      - Have had uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery

      - Be a non-smoker under 40 years of age

      - Have a BMI under 35

      - Be healthy<br><br>


      #### What does the process look like?

      Once a gestational carrier is identified, they are screened to be sure they are healthy and psychologically ready for the process. This is how the process usually goes:

      1. Matching – Connecting with an intended parent(s)
      
      2. Medical screening – Health checks to make sure everything is safe
      
      3. Legal agreements – Lawyers for both sides to protect everyone involved
      
      4. Embryo transfer – A clinic procedure where the embryo is placed in the uterus
      
      5. Pregnancy & birth – Regular check-ins, support, and preparing for delivery<br><br>


      #### Will I be paid or compensated?

      *Payment of a GC for surrogacy is prohibited in Canada, though her expenses can be reimbursed.*


      Since surrogates can’t be paid, they’re reimbursed for any expenses that come directly from the pregnancy. This can include:

      * Medical bills not covered by provincial health

      * Travel to and from appointments
      
      * Lost wages (in some cases)
      
      * Childcare during appointments
      
      * Vitamins, supplies, or other health needs


      For more information, see the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/biologics-radiopharmaceuticals-genetic-therapies/legislation-guidelines/assisted-human-reproduction/prohibitions-related-surrogacy.html" target="_blank">Government of Canada's guiance on surrogacy</a>.<br><br>


      #### How involved will I be as a surrogate?

      That depends on what feels right for you and the intended parent. Some surrogates like regular check-ins and to share the journey closely, while others prefer to keep things simple and more private. The important part is finding the right fit so everyone feels respected and supported.<br><br>


      #### What happens after the baby is born?

      The baby goes directly to the intended parent(s). Some surrogates and intended parents stay in touch as friends, while others keep a little more distance. It’s really about what both sides feel comfortable with.
