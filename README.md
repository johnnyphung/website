# Creative Theme for Jekyll

A Jekyll implementation of the [Creative Theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com).

An attractive one page Bootstrap theme perfect for creative portfolios and businesses

Based on Creative Theme v7.0.7 and Bootstrap v5.2.3.

## To use the Creative Theme template in your project

Creating a site with this particular Jekyll theme, is basically writing a markdown site.

- Start by adding your info in `_config.yml`.
- Don't forget to change `_data/footer.yml` to update the copyright.
- In `index.md` reorder or remove section as you prefer.
- You can also add other pages, like `links.md`.
- Edit `_data/menus.yml` to add links in the navigation bar.

# Development
To run the site locally for development:

1. **Install Ruby and Bundler**:
   ```bash
   # Install rbenv (recommended for macOS)
   brew install rbenv
   rbenv install 3.2.2
   rbenv global 3.2.2
   
   # Install Bundler
   gem install bundler
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Run with live reload** (recommended):
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
   ```
   
   Then open http://localhost:4000 in your browser. The site will automatically refresh when you make changes.

4. **Alternative: Run without live reload**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

Note: Developing for github pages is tricky. You should always rely on
[safe plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/) because any other, that's not
in the list will simply not run.
